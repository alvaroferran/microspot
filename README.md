# Microspot


##The project

The purpose of this work is the development of a mobile-microscope that can be used to diagnose global health diseases. The mobile-microscope is a device composed of a mobile phone, an optical system and a mechanical system to magnify and scan objects. We want to build a prototype that is open, robust, low cost, portable and adaptable.

This project is incubated within a collaboration between the Innovation and Robotics department of bq and MalariaSpot.org, a innitiative of the Technical University of Madrid.
